# wordle-words
The word list used by the game Wordle


I just used the Linux 'strings' command to pull these out of a solver dictionary that had lots of binary gunk in it.

Anyway, here it is if you want the cleartext list to use in your own helper program or whatever.

It's just a list of words and word-like strings, so there's really no license to be had here.
