The word list used by the game Wordle


I just used the Linux 'strings' command to pull these out.

I'm not sure if it's the real list, because some of the entries aren't even words. You can even see that within the first page of word candidates.

Eg: abcee abear abele abers abeam

Anyway, here it is if you want the cleartext list to use in your own helper program or whatever.

It's just a list of words and word-like strings, so there's really no license to be had here.
