The word list used by the game Wordle


I just used the Linux 'strings' command to pull these out of a solver dictionary that had lots of binary gunk in it.

A lot of the entries aren't even words, and some might be, but not English. The real wordlist is probably a lot shorter, and limited to actual English words.

Anyway, here it is if you want the cleartext list to use in your own helper program or whatever.

It's just a list of words and word-like strings, so there's really no license to be had here.
